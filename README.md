# LoopHeroPronounSwap
 Swapping the gendered language in loop hero to female pronouns and potential gender neutral in the future. Swaps for:
 - The hero
 - (my fork fixes a line that got missed) Someone the hero gets compared to
 - (my fork adds this) The Priestess' God 

To Install: grab "lang_eng.ini" from release and copy to your "\steamapps\common\Loop Hero\local" folder.  This will overwrite the original translation, so back up the file if you don't want to reverify later.
