encyclo_tile0_0="Why everything disappeared is a mystery. And why this wasteland is still here is a mystery too. You can’t just call it a normal road: there are no footprints, no signposts, no signs of any living beings anywhere near it. The uncanny nature of this road suggests it could be a manifestation of an idea rather than a self-sustained physical object. You’ve probably been a wanderer your whole life, so a space where you can travel is an indispensable part of your personality and occupation."
encyclo_tile1_0="Even before all this, there were incidents when life tended to cling to the dead body it used to inhabit. The tradition of burying the dead in special places rather than burning the bodies was forced upon people during the rise of a necrotic cult. They insisted it was a way of prolonging the lives of one’s relatives, albeit in a rather peculiar way. The cultists, of course, never cared about anyone’s feelings - but they did care about getting fresh bodies instead of piles of ash. That cult is ancient history now, but the tradition took root too well."
encyclo_tile2_0="The insanity going on around you is clearly visible when you look at the villagers. As if hypnotized, they refuse to cross the boundaries of their home settlements and constantly assure you they don’t have any business outside, if they remember correctly. They accept any outside metamorphosis going on around them as something absolutely normal for this world. Like chameleons, they fit and adapt into the world no matter where you put them. Could the same thing be said about everything else you managed to remember?#Their connection with this tiny fragment of reality is astounding: you might have no idea that a monster is waiting for you down the road, but the villagers already will have put a bounty on its head and will tell you it’s been terrorizing their home for ages... Yet no one will tell you how for exactly how many days or years."
encyclo_tile3_0="A small deciduous forest. Perfect for gathering branches. Groves are beautiful, but rather unsuitable for idle walks. Often groves serve as a home for the wild beasts, whose favorite tactic is a lengthy ambush and a swift leap at the victim’s throat. If you manage to cross a grove without encountering anything life-threatening, it doesn’t mean you were lucky to avoid a lurking predator - it only means the predator’s belly was already full."
encyclo_tile4_0="If your road leads you through an unfamiliar wheat field, beware. Scarecrows - primitive golems - guard the crops from the outsiders. Luckily, it’s pretty hard to wander here by accident: the golden sea of wheat can be seen from afar and is hard to miss. It’s also hard to miss the clanking and rattling sounds that its guardians make as they drag around their one-legged bodies, filled with straw and instinctive primitive magic."
encyclo_tile5_0="Usually, spiders are solitary creatures that prefer to remain unseen and lie in wait before attacking their prey. Not these species of spiders, however. Their anthill-like nests can be seen from afar. The hunter-spiders that scurry around prefer to openly pursue and attack their prey. Decomposed bones are embedded within the silvery walls of their webbed cocoons. Which is quite strange, because the spiders are perfectly capable of consuming bone tissue. Maybe these bones serve as reference marks for the builder spiders? Or are they some type of primitive animalistic decoration?"
encyclo_tile6_0="A vampire’s dwelling, first and foremost, is a way to demonstrate the vampire’s power and wealth - and only secondly, a place to live in. The owner has no need for the numerous rooms or exquisite decorations therein. You might even say a privileged vampire feeds not only on blood, but also on the admiration and envy of his brethren that come to visit on the rare guest nights. Maybe it’s the unending desire to impress each other that forces vampires to continue inventing the increasingly more sophisticated architectural designs."
encyclo_tile7_0="For a long time now, this place has proved to be fit for battles - which took place here numerous times over different periods of history. The earth was quick to absorb the blood of the fallen, but not their bones or armaments. Most of these battlefields had proper names and rich histories, now lost beyond memory. People who live around here are reluctant to scavenge the riches of the dead warriors - and even the animals try to stay away from the corpses. The feeling of neverending battle still rages here, even as death had claimed all of its participants. Whoever visits here risks becoming a part of a long-gone battle, and walk away with the sounds of combat forever stuck in their ears. Sooner or later those unlucky people find their way back here, only to become new members of the immeasurable army of ghosts."
encyclo_tile8_0="A very precise imitation of a human military camp. While lacking in their own progress, goblins are very quick to imitate anything that can help them survive and settle around new places. Camps like this one have already served multiple generations of these vile creatures, and do so very well. The goblins’ skill of imitating everything they see is ridiculously good: all camps they build are utterly identical to each other.#Moreover, for example, the camps are also full of tents - even though the goblins live and sleep on the ground outside. They just don’t know a camp could still work the same way without the tents."
encyclo_tile9_0="Originally, lighthouses were used for marine navigation at night-time – but at some point people also started using them to illuminate the land. They were usually built near important manufacturing sites, which had to continue their production even at night. Sometimes these towers were also used to illuminate the districts of big cities. Now, since all the celestial bodies are gone, they are more useful than ever. You’re not completely blind in this darkness, of course, but the light can help you move faster and with more confidence. Unfortunately, that is true not only for you."
encyclo_tile10_0="This rocky landscape yields no crops. Even crossing it is very hard. But life knows no boundaries, and it always finds a way to conquer even the harshest lands.#Natives of these rocky wastelands are usually quite sturdy and tough - probably because anyone less rugged simply wouldn’t be able to survive there."
encyclo_tile11_0="Mountains are always rich with rocks and snow. But finding anything else can be a real challenge there. Even breathing becomes difficult as you climb higher.#Why would animals and plants still choose to exist in such unfavorable conditions? Probably because there’s very little competition with other species. Few creatures would want to fight for survival in these harsh lands. Even passing through these lands is a challenge on its own."
encyclo_tile12_0="Coniferous forests are usually abundant in cold regions. The trees are well adapted to low temperatures. The life of a tree is passive, quiet, and without haste. For the many species that dwell in the forest, living there is an unending fight for survival. But the trees already know that in the end, they will always be the victors of this struggle. Sooner or later any forest-dweller will become nutrients for their roots to absorb. And the trees never stopped changing or adapting either. They’re just a bit lazy at it."
encyclo_tile13_0="It’s been a long time since trunks of these fir trees last saw sunlight. The same goes for all the creatures that live around here. For them, the disappearance of the sun is nothing really special. The only noise you can hear is the soft creaking of the trees. But even that doesn’t mean you’re alone. No one knows how many creatures might be hiding around here. Your eyes have to pick up even the slightest movements and your ears can’t fail you even when you're sleeping, if you wish to survive here. Only then do you have a chance to ambush the ones who’s trying to ambush you."
encyclo_tile14_0="The bright red color of the leaves and roots of these trees has no connection to their diet, although some may find it a somewhat sinister coincidence. Strictly speaking, the leaves are just rudimentary - for the plants in a blood grove, photosynthesis is only a secondary way to acquire energy. The vines hiding in the forest floor are quick to react to the twitching movements of any wounded or dying creature. In an instant the poor victim becomes entangled in them, to be dragged underground. How they can tell if a creature is dying is quite interesting - but not as interesting as the blood grove’s method of propagating its species. Those fleshy giants often mistaken for undead monsters because of their grotesque appearance - they are actually just a peculiar type of fruit, made from meat, bones and branches. During its short ^bloom,^ this ^seed^ uses its bare bloody flesh to attract predators - whose dead bodies will nourish the crimson sprouts of a new blood grove."
encyclo_tile15_0="The Cult of the Golden Arrow is one of the most ancient pagan cults. Sometimes it’s also called the Cult of Thunder and Lightning. There is some irony in calling a few standing stones and a simple ^roof^ above them a temple, though. But even today some people still keep building them. Why do they do it? It’s quite simple: it may be just a cult, and it may be pagan, but lightning storms in the regions with these temples actually grow more frequent. The cultists of the Golden Arrow tend to look down on other religions because their god can actually be summoned and seen by anyone, as opposed to the gods of their opponents. The goals of these cultists seem to remain a mystery even to themselves. The lightning tends to strike not only the cult’s potential enemies, but any other targets... Including the hapless cultists themselves. Perhaps they just love to see an uncontrollable power coming to this world by their will."
encyclo_tile16_0="Survival is quite a difficult task. Usually people commit their whole life to it. But if just surviving isn’t enough, if you crave answers to the questions you ask, if you want to have a peek at the secrets of creation - then a bookery is the place for you. The withered finger of a scribe will point you towards the right shelf, and his hands will provide you with a table, a stack of paper for your notes, and all the ink and candles you may need. Don’t mind the sickly and almost inhuman look of the scribes.#When exactly does the thirst for knowledge turn into servitude to it? The question is almost rhetorical. The transition is too smooth. You probably won’t even notice as the intoxicating feeling of superiority gained from new knowledge gives way to the desire to discover something even greater. And there you will be - passing ink and paper to a new neophyte, knowing they’re looking for answers they will never find."
encyclo_tile17_0="When knowledge of the world is compiled and starts to intertwine and mix, magic is born. There are no fancy rituals or shamanistic dances.#There’s not much information on how bookeries actually become abandoned. Usually, the farmers that bring food and supplies to the bookery just find the whole building ruined with the scribes gone. The chattiest of them say the scribes were very agitated when they last spoke with them - claiming the world’s existence itself started talking to them in the language of the cosmos, and soon they’d be able to tell the fate of the whole universe from just one leaf falling from a tree."
encyclo_tile18_0="A generic notion of a river, as if from a basic archetypal memory. It’s width, depth and current are absolutely constant for its whole length. Yet for a memory of a river, it uncharacteristically resists being left in an incomplete state. For one, it’s utterly impossible to envision a second river until the first river is complete. And since there’s no way to form an estuary as other big bodies of water no longer exist, it will never be complete. Remarkably, the existence itself seems to relish the presence of a river: the world around it grows stronger and more complete, as if waking up from a dream. Maybe it’s due to the natural circulation of water, the most common and necessary thing in our world."
encyclo_tile19_0="In the old days you could find such lanterns on every road. Their construction is quite basic, and the simple light-binding spell doesn’t require years of learning. Light from such lanterns will surely help you spot a night predator, but that’s not what’s keeping the roads safe - it’s just that no one wants to stay near a lantern for too long. No one knows where the old light spell came from, but there’s clearly nothing good in it. It feels like the light follows everyone it touches, watching and studying them. Even a solid rock or a thick cloth won’t hide you from its sight. Even the most horrible creatures of this world fear its otherworldly light, and many of them prefer to find another place for their dirty deeds."
encyclo_tile20_0="Mounds, bogs, and thousands of insects and mosses of all shapes and colors. A foolish traveler will die trying to cross it, a clever one will go around it, and a cunning one will lead their enemies to it. A long time ago a few tribes lived in the swamps: they used to build high towers so the giant mosquitoes wouldn’t reach them. Nothing is left of them now. Everything was either forgotten or merely rotted away, consumed by the swamp.#An interesting and terrifying fact: the swamp gases tend to induce self-destruction processes in all creatures capable of self-healing. Even if regeneration is purely magical in nature, the swamp will twist and reverse it, as if it leeching life itself. With that in mind, the tales about all swamps being connected to a terrible primordial beast slumbering deep underground don’t sound so silly anymore."
encyclo_tile21_0="This building is not just ^a^ simple arsenal. An humble name hides ^the^ ancient school of warcraft. One wouldn’t call the students of the Arsenal unrivaled fighters, but they are definitely always sought after.#The fundamental basis of the Arsenal is attaining mastery over every type of weapon and gear, no matter how exotic - and using them all together, as many as one can. Naturally, that would be hard to learn without a large variety of equipment at hand - that’s why the Arsenal also functions as the largest museum of warfare. Among its multiple exhibits are items so exotic, one wouldn’t even know how to handle them, use them or even wear them.#If you happen upon a clumsy-looking warrior bristling with a ridiculous amount of gear, don’t be too quick to laugh at him. It’s quite possible that he is a graduate of the Arsenal - and he’ll use all of his deadly inventory to teach you some respect."

The Labyrinth of Memories is the result of an attempt to achieve that goal.#The spells placed upon its walls can surreptitiously replace the memories of anyone traversing it with the memories of the long-gone architect of this place. Any human walking towards the center of the Maze is bound to pass through multiple key memory points, becoming a completely different person - the mage who designed and created this Labyrinth.#But even with all the metamorphoses the victim’s personality goes through, and with all the memories replaced, the complete transformation still never occurs. Even for all the fools trying to make it to the center in pursuit of the mage’s rumored treasure. It’s not known what mistake the dead mage made that led to this: maybe memories just aren’t enough to form a complete personality, or maybe there were errors in his spells or blueprints. Or maybe there weren’t any mistakes at all - and the first successful copy of the mage went back and intentionally damaged the Labyrinth to prevent the birth of another one. Who knows?"
encyclo_tile23_0="Rock-solid proof that humanity’s desire to conquer this world was born from their curiosity and obsession with standards. The Monument itself has been repaired and remade multiple times, so it noticeably differs from the original design. On the oldest maps, there is no Zero Meridian to be found - instead you’ll see a drawing of a lone white standing stone. Nowadays, the Meridian looks like a metal plate etched with cardinal directions, embedded into a square paved with slabs of stone.#Not much is known about the person who first installed this geographic point of reference. It seems they didn’t grow up to become a famous cartographer. But it’s clear they were a remarkably charismatic person - because even vampires, who tend to look down on human inventions, also accept the Zero Meridian as a standard in their geography teachings."
encyclo_tile24_0="Hardly any village has never been ravaged. Hunger, diseases, natural disasters, wars, wild animals, or any other evil imaginable will always come upon a human settlement. If you’re lucky, you’ll be able find a couple of families still living in the ruins, trying to get back to their old lives. If you’re not so lucky, you’ll find the inhabitants of this place already dead... some of them slowly walking around, trying in vain to remember their occupations and dreams in life. But when it comes to their dreams and desires, the first thing that comes to them is usually the wish to stuff bellies with delicious food. You certainly don’t look the part, but you’ll have to use force to prove it."
encyclo_tile25_0="A village under a vampire’s protection is often called a ^count’s land.^ Houses in these villages are much more sturdy, rich, and beautiful. And the same goes for their residents. But it would be too naive to think it’s a sign of the vampire’s philanthropy. For a vampire, a thriving human village is just another way to demonstrate their wealth and power. This fact, however, doesn’t really concern the farmers as long as they are well-fed and safe. A few villagers missing after an audience with the Count is a small price to pay for a peaceful life, if it doesn’t have to happen too often."
encyclo_tile26_0="Skillful blacksmiths almost literally put their hearts into their work. Creating artificial life is not the hardest of crafts, so after crafting their first slightly-twitching living armor the artisan will probably delve into this new occupation head-on. Blacksmith’s forges continually try to excel in the art of creating artificial life. Sometimes their creations are even able to ask questions and imitate free will. Any mage worth their salt would probably laugh at the work of a golemancing blacksmith: trying to use hammer and anvil to accomplish something that requires years of study might look childish to them. But a blacksmith would hardly care about such mockery. Because the creaking sound of every step a living armor makes brings true joy to its creator’s heart."
encyclo_tile27_0="There’s nothing really interesting about reeds. But seeing a part of a flowing river overgrown with reeds will certainly alarm an experienced traveler. It’s quite a rare sight, and there’s a number of reasons for that.#More often, such reed thickets are planted by the merfolk to create a food reserve for their river camps. Muddy water with a weak current is ideal for breeding the certain types of fish they consume. Plants fibers are also fit for building their primitive underwater dwellings. And let’s not forget that it’s much easier to hide in the numerous tall reeds.#But a traveler should stay positive: sometimes the reeds are nothing more than a mere result of simple natural processes. Still, you probably shouldn’t test these waters."
encyclo_tile28_0="A bridge can tell you a lot of things about the place where ended up. If you see some old ropes and a rotten plank instead of a normal bridge, stay vigilant: that place is definitely no good. Should you cross a river over a sturdy stone bridge, your future may look quite bright indeed. And if you happen to be a merchant by trade, the sight of a reliable and wide stone bridge designed to hold the weight of a trade caravan will definitely bring joy to your heart.#Only a few people understand that not only does a bridge cross the river, but the river also crosses the bridge."
encyclo_tile29_0="This structure does not belong in your homelands. It’s something completely new and otherworldly. The architecture is not overly eccentric, but something about this building just screams that it’s not from this universe.#Then why does the Lich’s Palace feel so menacing? Is it the unknown mineral it’s built from? Or maybe it’s the rare flashes of strange light in its empty rooms? No. Just come close enough, and you’ll instantly understand the whole building is an inseparable part of its mighty master himself and follows him wherever he goes."
encyclo_tile30_0="So, your path has led you to a wheat field. Now you can be perfectly sure there’s a village somewhere nearby. Or, in the worst-case scenario, the remains of a village. However... This simple rule can be broken, as oblivion and chaos often force the once inseparable objects to exist on their own. An overgrown field is a bit of a paradox, a creation without a creator. Maybe the scattered pieces of the world are trying to recombine according to the laws of logic and cause-and-effect relationships, maybe even forming new laws from scratch... But definitely not this time. A heavy haze of opportunity lingers around this place, trying to justify its existence, but to no avail."
encyclo_tile31_0="There is no mention of places like this from the times before the oblivion. It looks like some madman tried to create an imitation of a village by scattering a bag of various seeds and tending to them for a few dozen years. It’s hard to understand how this imitation actually works, but the connection between the forest and these wood villages is quite obvious. If we assume the forest is a living organism, one may suggest this might be its unique response to the apocalypse - either as an expression of pain, or an emergency adaptation to the events that occured. Whatever it might be, you’d better not go knocking on the doors of these false houses. It’s quite possible the forest also created some ^inhabitants^ for them."
encyclo_tile32_0="A blood grove in its natural habitat is completely inseparable from the woodlands around it. Which is actually quite strange, considering that its trees have absolutely no symbiotic connection with any other trees or plants, but that’s just the way it goes. Or went.#A hungry blood grove is a yet another artifact of the present time. The blood grove solves the paradox of its separate existence via heightened aggression and a modfied behavior. Its sharp roots are not just waiting for a weakened victim anymore - they try to attack any living creature that gets within their reach. It’s currently unknown what exactly this more aggressive way of hunting is compensating for, but it obviously isn’t very helpful. The trees are always in a half-withered state, regardless of how much prey they consume."
encyclo_tile33_0="Time manipulation has always been an important discipline of the magical studies, mostly because of the promise of immortality via suspending certain processes of the human body. And for many other useful reasons, of course. Sadly, the harm such manipulations bring outweighed the potential advantages. Once upon a time, these manipulations even nearly caused a global disaster. The chrono crystals are the aftermath of that disaster. These crystal formations are the world’s attempts to compensate for the violated laws of creation and level the flow of time where it was disrupted. One may think, incorrectly, that these crystals simply speed up time around them: but what they actually do is ^nudge^ forward the suspended time so that it may catch up with the overall pace."
encyclo_tile34_0="These mysterious towers have been known to exist since the ancient times. On rare occasions, a temporal beacon can just appear in a whirlwind of sand or vanish in the same fashion. But the reason for these events still remains a mystery. The origin of the time flow fluctuations around these constructions is also unknown - yet the fluctuations themselves seem completely natural and adhering to the laws of nature. The history knows few attempts to destroy or conquer temporal beacons, and all of them failed. The material that forms these towers can’t even be scratched. These beacons lack doors and windows, which brings us to another question: how can their inhabitants, the watchers, leave these constructions to perform their silent patrol of the lands around them?"
encyclo_tile35_0="One can certainly guess who would be the winner in a fight between lightning and wood. The sight of these charred stumps gazing at the sky full of ashes would discourage anyone. If you follow the straight lines of charred trees, they will lead you to the source of the damage - a storm temple. But the forest is hard to kill: even the most deeply burned stumps are capable of growing new roots, and new green sprouts will take over this place once again. The forest is going to wage this battle for dozens of years, and again and again it will be pushed back by rare flashes of dry storms.#Despite their dead appearance, burned forests are also home to some fearsome creatures. This harsh environment with the occasional lightning storm and forest fire befits only the toughest of creatures, who can easily slice their victims’ throats with their sharp teeth, claws, or blades. Sometimes they attack just to cool their bodies with fresh blood."
encyclo_tile36_0="The world has always been rough. The reason for humanity’s survival isn’t steel weapons or strength, it’s the human ability to come together against anyone who tries to take their lands or lives. And so the fight for survival gives birth to nations, civilizations and cultures. But one way or another, humanity’s triumph will always be fleeting, will always be interrupted, and will leave behind only the ruins filled with the remains of poor luckless people. Humanity’s ability to continuously create new ambitious empires is truly inspiring - and just as saddening is the human inability to realize their predecessors already had the same stone walls and castles, yet it was clearly not enough for their survival."
encyclo_tile37_0="Sometimes the extent of the bloodshed starts to defy all reason. Every long battle leaves behind a bloody mess of earth, flesh and bone. A road crossing through such places is called a blood path. You could try to shame the fallen warriors for not choosing a location more distant from the frequented roads - and making life quite inconvenient for those travel them often - but they will hardly hear you, being dead and all. The raging earth will never accept the bodies of the ex-combatants. Even after many years, their corpses can still be easily seen.#And sometimes some bloody remains even find enough strength to raise bones from the ground, so that they may fight their long-forgotten battle once more - a weird inertia of life ended by the bloodshed."
encyclo_tile38_0="The wreck of a ship on a sea cliff is a sad sight. But seeing the wreck near a thin river is a very strange sight indeed. In fact, such shipwrecks serve as sources of power for the sirens - the mages of the merfolk. No one knows exactly how it works, but a sunken ship filled with treasures and the dead crew is able to boost their magic powers. Probably it has something to do with the agony of approaching death. That would explain why these ships are often discovered on old battlefields. Another thing that supports this theory is the feeling of unity the fishmen experience during battle through their common desire to kill and not be killed."
encyclo_tile39_0="The only difference between this camp and all the other ones is a lookout tower. Not much of a distinction, one might think - but for the goblins the regular camp and the lookout are drastically unlike each other. It’s pretty obvious that a goblin lookout tower is a reaction to extremely unhospitable living conditions, because such conditions are the only thing that could force goblins to abandon their usual building template... for another template. The lookout tower allows goblins to cut down on the number of blind patrols into hostile territories. Goblin archers are able to spot their prey from afar, and can quickly inform the vanguards. Goblin lookouts can usually be found near swamps, which goblins really hate. But the thought of not robbing travelers on the hostile lands they hate even more."
encyclo_tile40_0="Hot sands of southern countries cover vast territories. Some researchers even insist that the sands grow every year. Give the desert enough time, and it will turn all land and its inhabitants into sand. You can forget about water: the desert will take every drop. The thirst of the desert can never be satiated. And the desert will gladly share that thirst with every visitor.#The lean constitution of the people who live in the desert can be explained through their mechanisms of thermoregulation. But there is an easier explanation: their life is a constant exhausting battle with the harsh environment."
encyclo_tile41_0="Sand giants ^forged^ by the hot winds. The sand dunes may look motionless, but that’s hardly the truth. Layer after layer the wind carries them onward, and the slow march of these giants never stops. While the dunes may look safe, it’s still better to avoid them. Just one thoughtless step, and you’ll be lucky if you only break your leg. A single gust of wind can cause a landslide that will become your doom. The air around the dunes is always hot, even at night. The scorching mountains of sand are powerful enough to heat up even the coldest northern winds. In the end, the dunes will take your life - and only they will decide whether your death will be quick and sudden, or long and painful."
encyclo_tile42_0="Thick vegetation is the only thing that keeps this stream from drying out. Water is the most precious treasure in the desert. Whole civilizations were built around the oases. A single lifesaving sip of water can unite people dying of thirst better than any treasure or common enemy. The peaceful atmosphere every oasis creates can calm various creatures and allow them to coexist in a small territory. But don’t think it’s a land of harmony and peace. Fights for water can be very brutal. The only good thing is that they only happen out of necessity - not just for fun or for show. Because every move is a waste of energy, and more heat that everyone here is trying so hard to avoid."
encyclo_tile43_0="Usually, outposts are built either by military forces of some country or by mercenaries looking for stable income. But their origin makes no difference to a traveler - either way the roads become safer at the cost of some coin. People tend to show little enthusiasm about the soldiers stationed at an outpost: it’s nice, of course, to be saved from the teeth and claws of a beast that suddenly attacked you on the way to the market - but how are you supposed to survive the winter now that they took half of the crops you wanted to sell?"
encyclo_tile44_0="This mountain is so big that it had to be singled out from other rock formations and given a separate name. There are a few tribes living around this mountain peak, but only the harpies are well known to us. They can easily cope with the thin air and the extremely cold winds that always blow down the peak’s slopes. Certain discoveries indicate the existence of a civilization clearly very advanced in magic arts, which at some point disappeared almost without a trace. Why it disappeared is still a mystery, as well as why such a hostile environment was chosen for its capital.#The few people who decide to explore the peak sooner or later reach the same conclusion: one ought to explore something more plain and easy."
encyclo_tile45_0="If the amount of your riches and treasures becomes so high there’s no point in hiding it anymore, you should think about building a treasury. Such structures were very common in the olden days, and one can easily guess why. Even now, more enchanted towers are still being found, some of them not even plundered. Practically every such tower is protected by enchanted stone guardians. Much more reliable and durable than their living counterparts, they will never betray their master nor leave their post with a part of the riches they vowed to protect (unlike guards of flesh and bone). Treasuries are usually found in distant places far from any civilization - that’s why common thieves rarely decide to go on a journey to look for them."
encyclo_tile46_0="The stone guardians are not concerned with the fact their masters are long dead and have no need for their riches anymore. The enchantment placed on the gargoyles not only forces them to guard the treasure, but also makes them return it if some lucky thief happens to successfully steal any. For years they will chase after even the smallest coin, to find and punish the person who stole it. Gargoyles will lose the hopeless battle with human greed, that much is certain; and the decayed tower will never be refilled again. But that will never stop the gargoyles from trying to complete their duties, and their attempts will go on - until the tower little by little runs out of stone as it builds new gargoyles."
encyclo_tile47_0="Quite a peaceful place. Predators have no chance to approach their target unnoticed, and large herbivorous animals only go there if they are able to run away or defend themselves with their large horns.

There’s always a place to set up camp, some branches to make a fire, and no one will stop you from having a good rest."
encyclo_tile48_0="If a family has enough resources, power and smarts, it is destined to become a great dynasty. The offspring will cherish the memories of their ancestors’ heroic deeds and tragic mistakes, and will try to become even better - or, at least, not to become any worse. They know existence itself is a great responsibility and idleness is the greatest of sins. To them, the greatest achievement imaginable is to be deemed worthy of being buried in the family crypt among their honorable relatives, and see the crypt doors open for them just before they die.#Alas, the ancestral crypt tradition is nearly forgotten now, and only a few of them remain intact. The best-preserved crypt has undergone a transformation and now welcomes every lost soul. Maybe it decided the whole world is its legacy now and anyone could learn from the ancestors, whether they are related or not."
encyclo_tile49_0="A long walk through a blooming meadow is a simple and cheap way to fix one’s mental health. One’s physical health would benefit from that too, of course. Some people think it’s thanks to the pleasant flower aromas and the relaxing rustle of grass.

Well, maybe the people who lived there didn’t want to learn from their mistakes."
encyclo_tile51_0="Being highly social creatures, humans always tend to help each other. This survival strategy is very effective and profitable. That’s why even crowded living and lack of resources can’t force people into living separately. Townspeople live and work in sturdy stone houses.

Every citizen is trying to be smarter and more successful than their neighbor - because when the competition with the outside world is no more, you are forced to compete with the people around you.

The waterskin could fill itself when shaken - a priceless miracle, as the caravan's path lied through the desert. We aren't yet used to the heat of the southern roads.#The attack was sudden and swift. Streams of sand turned carts over and impaled the cattle. The attackers moved freely in the sandstorm. The survivors were few. We filled our waterbags with camel blood, knowing full well how hard it would be to return home by foot. I found Ibhan's dried-up body. His waterbag was useless, as though stripped of all magic...^#- The last entry in the ledger of Caar the Merchant"
encyclo_enemy48_1="^Reject the flesh. Become my kin. Your path shall be a radiant eternity.^#That’s what the sand traveler told me when we had first met. I laughed off his suggestion as I drew my sword, all too eager to cut my answer into his crumbly body.#But now I am very old, my death is at hand, and it scares me. With sorrow in my eyes I look upon this land that slowly aged into desert, and hope out there they still expect me to accept the offer.^#- From the diary of an unknown man"
encyclo_enemy48_2="^I'm telling you, I've got an admirer! And he's hot, too. Tall and handsome — well, more of a mysterious type, so I haven't exactly seen the face, but — look, it's not the point. #He's into me. Follows me everywhere. To a village, through a field, amidst the marshes... if that's not true love, then what is?#I think he's just too shy to break the ice. Tomorrow, I'll take initiative.^#— from Edna's letter"
encyclo_enemy49="A witch would never miss an opportunity to join a fight, even if she has no stake in it. Her numerous medical theories demand field testing too insistently to be ignored, and the wound-filled battles are the proving grounds of her dreams."
encyclo_enemy49_0="^No, it’s YOUR methods that are far too cruel! I understand that you hate hurting people, so do I.#But how do you expect to help the living if you only dissect the dead?#I’m fed up with this! I already found myself a nice patch of land for a future home, where no idiots nor their silly moralizing would ever disturb me.^#- From the letters of the Morel City Medical Academy"
encyclo_enemy49_1="^We were just kids. A ratwolf got us both that horrible night - ripped my belly open and bit through my skull, then tore into my sister's throat.#When I woke up, I was in a witch's hut and all my wounds were gone. The sister was nowhere to be seen.#^Why didn't you save her?^ I cried out.#^Only had the time to save one of you,^ she replied, pointing at the door.#^Why me and not her?^#^Your injuries were more exciting.^#- One of the stories collected by Gregor The Suspicious"
encyclo_enemy49_2="^That’s my last chance right there,^ Jonah muttered as he went into the woods on his shaky legs. In the morning he returned, fit as a fiddle. The witch cured his terrible cough and the black poxmarks: for an entire month, everything was fine.#Then it all got worse. On Bone Friday, Jonah started muttering and gurgling like an angry herring. On Bright Week, he tried to eat the elder’s wife.#When we locked the poor sod in the granary, he went numb and shrivelled overnight.#^And when we were dragging Jonah’s corpse to the grave it turned to dust – and that's when we saw he had a gruff toad for a heart!^#- A village rumor"
encyclo_enemy50="The term ^totem^ might be too strong a word for this contraption. There’s nothing magical about it, just several mediocre iron shields tied to a sturdy pole with a rope. It’s the witch who diverts any excessive violence away from her current test subjects and into the totem - after all, reviving the dead falls outside her expertise."
encyclo_enemy50_0="^Sarge refused me a furlough again and left me to keep watch for the third time this week. Says I’m not coming home until I learn to shoot straight. But I'm good with the bow, I swear! I always hit the target from a hundred steps at the range, I take proper care of my bow, I check it before every patrol. But the moment I climb the tower it's like all the arrows want to live in the woods. I suppose I’m just being nervous.#It's quiet tonight. Perhaps I’ll come home soon. Say hello to Father from me. Yours very sincerely.^#- A letter from the frontlines"


encyclo_item0_0="^An absolutely marvelous piece of woodwork! Seeing the elegant carvings on it sends shivers down my spine. All these holes and hollows that defy my understanding! Such a tablet should be hung above the door, so you may marvel at it every time you enter. Or at least that’s what I would do. Our boy said he was going to place some vials on it, but he knows nothing about aesthetics.#I felt a surge of energy while loading it.^#- From the diary of Volgrim, the first carriage driver"
encyclo_item1_0="^An exquisitely crafted piece of sitting furniture, fitting for only the most highborn of nobles. The red cushions and the woody... ehm... wood parts form a perfect color combination that brings joy to the eyes. Many times during my journey I considered resting on it, but I feared that my unkempt travel clothes would not befit such a splendid piece of furniture. I’ll wait till I can find a decent double-breasted jacket at the camp.#I was very thirsty while loading it.^#- From the diary of Volgrim, the first carriage driver"
encyclo_item2_0="^One of the more magnificent and dimension-defying pieces of furniture I’ve ever seen or transported in my carriage. The carvings on the doors and shelves, the gold-plated handles, the gentle hint at the immeasurable richness of the clothes it must contain, oh, what masterful craftsmanship! - that’s what I was telling myself as I examined it on my way home.#Strained my back while loading it.^#- From the diary of Volgrim, the first carriage driver"
encyclo_item3_0="^As I looked at this scattering of small forged iron pieces in front of me, I tried envisioning it as a thing of beauty. No doubt this used to be an expert work of a shoemaker, and I’m sure it performed quite admirably in the past... But what else can you say about nails? They all have the same length, width and look, there are no intricate patterns nor complex geometric proportions to them. Some might even say they contain no aesthetic value whatsoever! But I nevertheless enjoyed this sight, even though it did not evoke any lofty thoughts. There must a simple beauty to those nails.#Pricked my finger while loading them.^#- From the diary of Volgrim, the first carriage driver"
encyclo_item4_0="^When I first laid my eye on this knife I was struck with awe - the unbelievably perfect combination of herbal scent coming from it, and the rays of light reflecting from the blade. Oh, how I envy the person skillful enough to truly wield this marvelous tool! On my way back I even considered changing my career several times; but I chased that thought away. A good carriage driver can’t have his head in the clouds - and if I can’t even properly operate my carriage, then I shouldn’t even consider operating such sharp tools!#Cut myself while loading it. Only a bit, though. It already healed.^#- From the diary of Volgrim, the first carriage driver"
encyclo_item5_0="^What a magnificent woodcutting tool that had ended up inside my carriage on this... whatever time of day it is. Neither metal nor wood of this tool bears any exquisite carving - but the true beauty of this axe lies in its function and purpose. It’s simple, yet so convenient and practical! Merely grasping it with my hand makes me feel as if I’m doing something useful! I thought about chopping down some trees, but the wood wouldn’t last until the camp anyway - so it would just needlessly dull the blade. And even thinking about that makes me frown.#Caught a splinter while loading it.^#- From the diary of Volgrim, the first carriage driver"
encyclo_item6_0="A great bowl, with some great edible nuts in it. While I was driving through the hills, they were jumping and rattling about within their bowl, producing a kind of music. Hope there are enough cashews in there. I enjoy nuts of all sorts, of course, but if there aren’t any cashews in my portion then I’ll be quite upset.#I was thinking about having a pint of beer while loading them.^#- From the diary of Volgrim, the first carriage driver"
encyclo_item7_0="^I always liked how cured meat is often wrapped with a string, forming an artful pattern - and how the string still remains in place when you cut off a slice. To be frank, I always thought the wrapping was there just to make the meat look good, but our cook told me that it’s done so that a ham would keep its shape while suspended in the air. One learns something new every day!#I was thinking about getting some side dish to this meat while I was loading it.^#- From the diary of Volgrim, the first carriage driver"
encyclo_item8_0="^Garlic has almost no negative traits. Not everyone likes it, and few would kiss you after you’ve eaten it. But not everyone would’ve done so before the garlic either. Either way, even if it had more negative traits, I would still love the way it looks while hanging from the ceiling in those neat little bunches. It can be stored for months, and used to spice up nearly any dish.#Became more resilient while I was loading it.^#- From the diary of Volgrim, the first carriage driver"
encyclo_item9_0="^Oh, how I would like to shake hands with the master artisan behind this metalwork and the carving! Every curve reflects the candlelight in a way that reveals careful intent behind every little detail of this functional masterpiece. I can’t even imagine how glorious it would look upon a mantelpiece in a mansion, with all three candles lit and shining. I’m sure it would be able to blind anyone with its beauty... In a good way, of course.#Had to squint my eyes while loading it.^#- From the diary of Volgrim, the first carriage driver"
encyclo_item10_0="^It’s been a long time since a painting impressed me like this. But it’s also been a long time since I’ve last seen a painting. But that fact does not detract from the qualities of this specific portrait. Great artwork - breathtaking brushstrokes! - and such an exquisite golden frame around it. Yet I must say the picture itself reminds me of someone. Maybe I knew its creator? I ought to ask at the camp.#I felt as if higher forces were watching me while I was loading it.^#- From the diary of Volgrim, the first carriage driver"
encyclo_item11_0="^If you are to have a decent dinner, I say you ought to enjoy it only off a plate such as this one. Although food is always great by itself, you should never forget about the ritual. It’s not just about filling the stomach - it’s also about enjoying the view, and enriching your sense of beauty. I think the presence of this fine, pure, beautifully etched metal ought to do wonders for the digestion.#Felt a strong desire to live and feel alive while loading it.^#- From the diary of Volgrim, the first carriage driver"
encyclo_item12_0="^A heavy yet still wonderful piece of furniture! On my way back I couldn’t help myself, and stopped my carriage to enjoy a quick nap. I shouldn’t have done it, of course - but sometimes you have to indulge yourself, especially with such a great bed nearby. There’s certainly nothing bad or wrong about sleeping in a carriage or a tent, but it’s things like this bed that truly bring out the benefits of civilized living.#Strained my back while loading it, but when I returned to the camp everything was fine.^#- From the diary of Volgrim, the first carriage driver"
encyclo_item13_0="^How well this table is hammered together! Most people only see some planks and their apparent crudeness, but I can see the work of a true engineer aiming high! The table legs are placed just right to support the weight of any feast, and the planks are fit together so well - down to the tiniest notches on the rough edges - that even bread crumbs won’t fall between them.#Was thinking about having dinner while loading it.^#- From the diary of Volgrim, the first carriage driver"
encyclo_item14_0="^It is my opinion that such furniture has to be placed near windows, so you can see how beautifully the light from the setting or rising sun shines on the stained glass and all the objects behind it. Even if there is no sun now, I still hope that someday it will return - and this shelf will be waiting for it, standing at just the right place.#Wanted to put something on the shelves while loading it.^#- From the diary of Volgrim, the first carriage driver"
encyclo_item15_0="^A hunk of metal riddled with rust holes, barely holding onto a stick thanks to a single awkward nail. Don’t know who was using it - but what I do know is that I would never let this person near my tools.#Cut all my fingers while loading it.^#- From the diary of Wizgrem, the second carriage driver"
encyclo_item16_0="^Covered with some lousy hair that makes my allergies act up! Is it really so hard to wash your knife when you’re done using it? Maybe it’s better to just throw it out, it’s so dull anyway. I’m not surprised it’s covered with hair - you’d have to hit a wolfrat, like, a thousand times to make just a single cut. Or is it ratwolf...? Bah, who cares!#Kept sneezing while loading it.^#- From the diary of Wizgrem, the second carriage driver"
encyclo_item17_0="^I’m sure our blacksmith has one just like this somewhere in his stash. Why the hell did they need me to bring it? And even if he doesn’t - it’s just a chunk of metal for hitting other chunks of metal, surely you can replace it with something else. And speaking of smithing, isn’t the blacksmith supposed to make these himself? Isn’t that’s why he’s called a blacksmith in the first place?#Dropped it on my foot while loading it. Good thing my toes are quite sturdy, didn’t feel a thing.^#- From the diary of Wizgrem, the second carriage driver"
encyclo_item18_0="^Seriously? You send a whole carriage after a piece of burned bread?! Like I have nothing more to do except driving back and forth through broken terrain just for the fun of it! Well, come to think of it - yeah, that is the case. But if that boy can go out there and bring back some logs and stones, he could’ve brought something this small with him too!#I was furious while loading it.^#- From the diary of Wizgrem, the second carriage driver"
encyclo_item19_0="^I don’t even know what I hate more: this bowl of moldy soup, or our camp’s coordination. Who even thinks that a carriage driving along the bumpy road is the perfect way to transport a lidless vessel full of liquid?! Well, thanks a lot! Now I’ll have to clean these disgusting stains from my carriage!#Took a sip while loading it. Just so it would spill less, nothing else.^#- From the diary of Wizgrem, the second carriage driver"
encyclo_item20_0="^If there’s anything I really hate driving around in my carriage, it’s food. It stinks, it leaves crumbs and stains all over the place, and sometimes it even attracts beasts from the road with the smell. And cheese is the worst food there is, ticks all the marks. Except maybe it doesn’t attract the monsters - only the slimes attack the carriage nowadays, and even that is rare. I’m even considering removing the steel plates off the sides to speed up the ride.#Plugged my nose while loading it.^#- From the diary of Wizgrem, the second carriage driver"
encyclo_item21_0="^Oh, Volgrim would be so happy to deliver this thing. ^Such craftsmanship, look at that metalwork, what a carving - blah blah blah!^ He’s so overjoyed to deliver absolutely whatever and drive wherever - why do we even keep tossing the damn coin to see who drives the carriage?! Beats me! Anyway - this pendant is actually pretty beautiful, sort of. If it wasn’t so old and the silver wasn’t so dull, I might not even be feeling embarrassed to bring it to the camp.#Felt a tad calmer while loading it.^#- From the diary of Wizgrem, the second carriage driver"
encyclo_item22_0="^That’s just great. A book you can’t even read. Why do we even need this pile of decomposed pages? Can’t even take it to the john, for one reason or another. And even if you could read it - surely the people back at the camp have something far more important to do during the apocalypse than reading books!#Lost a page while loading it.^#- From the diary of Wizgrem, the second carriage driver"
encyclo_item23_0="^If I were to make a list of all my most favorite items that I delivered in my carriage, this mirror would surely make it in the top three. Naturally, anyone can see the craftsmanship is absolutely masterful - there’s no need to describe it in detail. But what’s the best about it is how it reflects everything so perfectly. I even managed to have a look at our Veteran while driving into the camp. Her face may be quite surly and no one has ever seen her smile, but that doesn’t tarnish her beauty one bit.#Played with the rays of reflected light for a bit while loading it.^#- From the diary of Volgrim, the first carriage driver"
encyclo_item24_0="^Don’t know who needs this yet another crude tool. We don’t even have a mine! This pick will be collecting dust in a corner, and that’s it! And it’s poorly made too - I’m not a master pick-crafter or anything, but even one look is enough to see that just grabbing it will give you splinters. And its metal tip is just waiting for a chance to fall through your foot.#Stumbled over a stone while loading it.^#- From the diary of Wizgrem, the second carriage driver"
encyclo_item25_0="^Why do I always get such disgusting shipments? Lay it down carefully, watch it constantly, don’t let it break during the trip, they say! Was I ever careless, even once?! And did my cargo ever actually require being handled with care? And here we go again: just some pieces of glass. What’s so great about this? No one would even notice if there was a dozen cracks on every one of them.#Spotted a coin on the ground while loading it.^#- From the diary of Wizgrem, the second carriage driver"
encyclo_item26_0="^For the first time in my life I was actually physically revolted by my cargo. All this soot and lard that’s impossible to wash off... I can’t even imagine what slob was using this pan. And, of course, we need to take it back home in my carriage instead of just leaving this rubbish where it belongs.#Felt sick while loading it. Got better after returning to the camp.^#- From the diary of Wizgrem, the second carriage driver"
encyclo_item27_0="^Can’t say anything good about this. The blade is all dull; the handle is unhandy and will definitely give you blisters. It will surely break after a few clumsy hits on the kitchen table. Maybe it can be used to scare away some very cowardly folks. It’s too tiny to be a good weapon - and too awful to be a good kitchen utensil. But who am I to tell this to the supply specialists?#Didn’t even cut myself while loading it.^#- From the diary of Wizgrem, the second carriage driver"
encyclo_item28_0="^So what - a thing any child can build from a bunch of sticks is now considered important cargo too? And a child could have done a way better job! This stool looks so rickety that I’d rather sit on the ground. It’s much softer and won’t break under your ass.#Hit my knee on it while loading it.^#- From the diary of Wizgrem, the second carriage driver"
encyclo_item29_0="^An absolutely useless object in its current condition. The lock is literally broken - and I’m not nagging this time, it really is broken, you can ask anyone! And who would need a chest without a lock? It can’t protect you from thieves, it gathers dust, and it makes it harder to grab the things you put in it. It objectively has no use.#Stumbled upon it and fell while loading it. Didn’t drop anything, I think.^#- From the diary of Wizgrem, the second carriage driver"


encyclo_res1_0="One would think it’s just a piece of common wood, but even common wood is quite rare now. My memories about the existence of tree branches are quite foggy, and not enough to fully materialize them.#Almost all the sticks I’m able to find during my travels literally vaporize if you so much as reach out for them.#The few branches and logs that still remain in my hands will certainly be put to use for the restoration of this world."
encyclo_res3_0="As I walk down the path, sometimes I find pieces of rubble and rock under my feet - and each time I pick one up I feel like I’ve never done it before. But in this world, any small piece of rock counts.#It’s strange, but when I gather enough pebbles in my pocket they somehow merge into one big rock.#It seems like the world is trying to restore itself. I suppose I’ll help with that."
encyclo_res5_0="If I use a weapon or a piece of armor for some time, I get used to it. It becomes an ordinary part of the world around me.#But if I replace it with something new, more often than not I won’t be able to remember anything about the old gear soon enough. All that I remember is that it was ^something useless and made of metal.^#That’s how these tiny pieces of metal appear in my pockets. They cling to each other as if they were magnetized - and eventually they fuse into full-fledged metal ingots."
encyclo_res7_0="Finding food in this erased world is becoming more and more difficult. I have to grab everything you can find - wheat from the fields, ratwolf meat and so on.#The only good thing about this global oblivion is that it also affects the feeling of hunger: it doesn’t distract me from all the other troubles."
encyclo_res8_0="A small sphere. I’m not sure - but I think it appeared in my pocket after fighting a big pack of monsters.#The sphere pulses in my hand and feels like it’s growing in size, but it actually isn’t.#If I look at it, I get an overwhelming desire to make the world around you better. I should give it to the builders in our camp."
encyclo_res9_0="Don’t know why I called it an ^orb^ - just to name it somehow, I guess. It looks more like a skull: not a human one, though.#A feeling of great despair overwhelms me whenever I look at it. I lose all my will to fight, or to do anything at all - even living. I really shouldn’t be looking at it. But here’s the strangest thing: if I squeeze it in my fist it does the opposite - it fills me with overwhelming will to live. What a strange thing.#Somehow I can feel that if I am to find myself at death’s door, this sphere will give me enough strength to dash back to the camp."
encyclo_res11_0="A ^book^ is a bit too strong of a word for it, but let’s leave it at that.#Most of the pages inside are blank, and others are either half-erased or written in an unknown language.#I should bring it back to the camp: I think I should be able to find someone who’s able to get some information from it."
encyclo_res13_0="The world doesn’t exist anymore, but I still remember some parts of it. Though my memory often fails me: things I thought were certain sometimes become something else.#A meadow full of fresh grass begins to bloom if I close my eyes just for a second. A rocky cliff - and I was sure it was just a big rock - turns into a mountain peak in the blink of an eye.#When such transformations pile up, a complete and physically perceptible metamorphosis is born. I can’t describe it at all, because its form is constantly changing entirely at random."
encyclo_res15_0="A cluster of particularly solemn, sorrowful memories.#Be it a skeleton risen from the grave against its will or a vampire forced to cause suffering to everyone else, any undead reminds me of death. Everything in the world is forgotten - even the meaning of death.#I have to keep reminding myself of this. Luckily, these days I can physically carry these thoughts and memories with me - as pitiful remains, or as more palpable Orbs of Afterlife."
encyclo_res17_0="A piece of the cosmos itself. A shard of time. A fragment of something infinite and immeasurable.#I can’t feel its shape even when holding it in my hand: it’s like I’m grasping nothing.#Things like this come into our world with various creatures capable of magic. Only they can extract the pieces of the astral plane and use them for their own needs."
encyclo_res19_0="A materialized crumb of inspiration. When I see someone else’s craftsmanship or handiwork, I feel a desire to create something too. Shame I have no skills for that.#But I can’t help but picking up all the different pieces left from the intricate chests or the freakish living scarecrows I encounter.#I’m sure I can find some skillful craftsmen back at the camp who will be able to find good use for this newfound inspiration."
encyclo_res21_0="The world is gone, but nature always adapts - and living fabric is the proof of that. This is a small root that’s in constant motion.#It’s twisting and wiggling in my hand, as if it’s trying to find some soil to grow in. Multiple roots will cling to one another and form a single sphere: only then do they to calm down and fall into some form of slumber.#It seems these roots are trying to get closer to other plants and living creatures in this empty world. I don’t think we should plant them at the camp, though. Wouldn’t want anything nasty to grow from it."
encyclo_res23_0="A spherical droplet, cold to the touch and seemingly fluid - but that’s not exactly the truth.#It pools in my hand like a big droplet, then starts crawling about like a swarm of tiny insects. Can’t be sure it’s not actually made insects, but I can’t prove otherwise. If I collect enough of this shapeless mass, it forms a small sphere and stops acting all alive. I’m going to call those spheres ^Orbs of Unity.^#At first I thought those droplets were slime chinks. But it seems this material can be found around all sorts of liquid or swarming creatures."
